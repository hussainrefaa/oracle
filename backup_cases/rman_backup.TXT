Hii
 for the first database(source) you follow the same way to set the database 
in archivelog and when you backup the database with archivelog you can delete 
the input archivelog after backed up [ backup database plus archivelog delete input;]

to make things easy you  make sure that the target database resides in the same location
 as the source one, as well oracle_sid and instance_name so it turns to the situation 
"recovering from lost control file"

for the next database(target) you need to copy all the back set from the first one to some
 directory accessible to the target database, configure rman so that it will search for the backupset
 from that directory 
-even you don't have to create the database using DBCA but it's ok.
 -- get the source dbid
sql> select dbid from v$database;
1161144072
-if your target database are runing, make sure it's shutdown using sql>shutdown immediate
normar process[like recoverying from lost control file] 
- RMAN> RMAN
  RMAN> connect target /
  RMAN> set dbid soruce-dbid
  RMAN> startup nomount
  RMAN> restore spfile from 'D:\backup\C-dbid-20070914-00';
  or using from autobackup
  RMAN> startup force nomount
  RMAN> startup mount;
  RMAN> show all; 
  make sure you reset the configuration appropriately beacause it will be overwritten as 
  the configuration are stored in the control  file unless u are using catalog
   RMAN> restore database;
   RMAN> recover database; //never do with noredo unless the backup are from noarchivelog database,
         or u don't want to apply the redo that will cost u losing things!!
   RMAN> alter database open resetlogs;

here, u can make a full backup to the target [it's not an issue in 10g and later]
