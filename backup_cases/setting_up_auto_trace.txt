About AUTOTRACE
-----------------------------------
You can automatically get a report on the execution path used by the SQL optimizer and the
statement execution statistics. The report is generated after successful SQL DML (i.e., SELECT,
DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE, and INSERT) statements. It is useful for monitoring and tuning the performance
of these statements.

Controlling the Report
--------------------------------------------------------
You can control the report by setting the AUTOTRACE system variable:
• SET AUTOTRACE OFF: No AUTOTRACE report is generated. This is the default.
• SET AUTOTRACE ON EXPLAIN: The AUTOTRACE report shows only the optimizer
execution path.
• SET AUTOTRACE ON STATISTICS: The AUTOTRACE report shows only the SQL statement
execution statistics.
